## Experience

I am a beginner in the field of coding with a week of experience on GitHub. My journey started with a tutorial on Arduino coding, which sparked my interest in this field. Since then, I have been exploring various aspects of coding and version control using GitHub.

## Skills

As a beginner, I am still in the process of building my skills. However, I have gained a basic understanding of:

- GitHub and version control
- Arduino coding
- HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (beginner level)

I am eager to learn more and improve my skills in these areas.
